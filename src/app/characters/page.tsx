At some point, Melinas body was burned, which left her bodiless and as a roaming spirit with no memory of her purpose given to her by her mother. And so, she looked for a way to go to the foot of the Erdtree to ascertain her given purpose, and to be able to govern her movement, seemingly lost as a spirit, meeting and travelling with Torrent at some time.</p>

She had two older brothers, Radahn and Rykard. Ranni was also an Empyrean, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed Queen Marika as the divine ruler of the Lands Between. The Two Fingers chose her as a potential successor and granted her a Shadow by the name of Blaidd to be her vassal. He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by Iji, a troll blacksmith who served the Carian royals. Led by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her Dark Moon. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery. Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a snowy crone, known simply as the Snow Witch, who would go on to become her secret mentor. She was an old witch well versed in cold-based sorceries, and she taught Ranni to fear the dark moon as she imparted her cold sorcery. The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Rannis sigil and symbol of her power and authority. At some point, Rannis father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second Elden Lord. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new stepmother.</p>

But since Radagon and Marika were in fact the same person, Malenia and Miquella were born afflicted. Malenia was afflicted with the Scarlet Rot, which ravaged her from within and would cost her several limbs, while Miquella was afflicted with eternal childhood, unable to ever grow into adulthood. At some point, Malenia encountered a blind swordsman who had sealed away an Outer God of Rot. The swordsman became her master, and trained her in the ways of the blade, allowing her to gain wings of unparalleled strength. Malenia would eventually become a warrior without peer. She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights (who vowed to fight next to her despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh, as well as worshippers, who believed her a goddess. Members of House Marais, who were all sickly born, were naturally drawn to the beautiful and fierce Malenia who became such a powerful warrior in spite of being born into rot, and requiring prosthesis to fight. Malenia and Miquella were close, and Malenia would become her brothers sworn blade and protector, while Miquella worked tirelessly to try and undo the curses they had both been born into. While unable to find a cure for his sister, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold that could keep the Scarlet Rot ravaging Malenias body at bay.</p>

                    <p className='mt-10 mb w-[90%] ml-14'>Queen Marika was originally of the same stock as the Numen people. She was an Empyrean who would ascend to godhood and become the vessel of the Elden Ring. As an Empyrean, she was gifted a shadow, her half-brother Maliketh. Desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring, and had her shadow Maliketh guard it, thus establishing the Golden Order. Marika took a consort, Godfrey, who became the first Elden Lord. In the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree, but with Godfrey at the head of her armies, Marika persevered and the Erdtree would reign supreme as the embodiment of the Golden Order itself. One of these wars was waged against the Fire Giants, who met defeat when Marika slew their fell god. Unable to extinguish the Flame of Ruin atop the frigid northern mountains, a credible threat to the Erdtree, she cursed the last of the giants to forever tend to it. Fire Monks, who had fought on the side of the Erdtree during the war against the Fire Giants, were also left behind to watch over the flame, some of whom fell under the spell of the fire and began worshipping the Fire God. With the Erdtree now supreme, Marika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey, as well as his and Marikas offspring, would always be counted as the first of the demigods, and would forever be known as the Golden Lineage. With her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past. When Godfreys last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded. Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Betweend, robbing them of their grace, thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then be revived and eventually brought back with their guidance of grace returned. After Godfreys banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[18] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children Radahn, Rykard and Ranni to demigod status. Marika and Radagon would go on to have two children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella, who like Marika herself and Radagons daughter Ranni, were Empyreans, and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth one and the same, in fact Radagon was described as Marikas male other self. Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.</p>
